# Todo / Ideas

1. Fix home directory folder structure, better security. Dont copy e.g. aws credentials to the s3 bucket.
2. Test that service works correctly during packer step.
3. somehow test packer locally to speed up dev process?
2. how do I make this reusable?
3. Maybe split up the tf file into several smaller ones.
4. cronjob for regular backups during server play too?
5. Randomly generated bucket names (we dont care about the names)
