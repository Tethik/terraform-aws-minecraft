# Todo / Ideas

1. Fix home directory folder structure, better security. Dont copy e.g. aws credentials to the s3 bucket.
3. somehow test packer locally to speed up dev process?
2. how do I make this reusable?
3. Maybe split up the tf file into several smaller ones.
4. cronjob for regular backups during server play too?


Terraform->Module for reusability!
